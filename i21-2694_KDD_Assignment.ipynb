400 kcal energy and could provide 5 - 10 g of protein / day . nowadays , school nutrition programs are running as the national programs , world - wide . national school lunch program in the united states \\n there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries . in vietnam , \\n school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes . in iran a national free food program ( nffp ) \\n is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students . however , this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio - economic situation are not covered by nffp . although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas , many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food . \\n hence , nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group . \\n furthermore , lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp . on the other hand , \\n the most important one is ministry of education ( moe ) of iran , which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools . \\n the ministry of health ( moh ) is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs . \\n welfare organizations , along with charities , have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family . \\n provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations . \\n parent -

welfare is 19.3 ( or = 19.3 , ci = 2.5 - 3.9 , p = 0.04 ) . \\n the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . \\n this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , \\n this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . \\n the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . \\n allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . \\n advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity \\n angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study \\n another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . \\n it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , \\n no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . \\n in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . \\n there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . \\n this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female \\n although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . \\n a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . \\n the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . \\n the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . \\n there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . \\n hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis \\n accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences \\n . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . \\n advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . \\n providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . \\n another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . \\n advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . \\n mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . \\n moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . \\n although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this \\n regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . \\n the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . \\n assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . \\n furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . \\n the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . \\n regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe . \\n community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .\", 'abstract': \"background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran . \\n the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) . \\n however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population . \\n the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population . \\n the pre- and post -

world clinical practice . in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age , 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years , particularly those with pe . in a study from north india , \\n men constituted 70% of our registry , more than those reported from vellore registry ( 48% ) , but similar to those reported in the endorse ( epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting ) study ( 69% ) . \\n one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study . \\n fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis . \\n this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy . \\n a total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore . \\n our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) . \\n most ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb . \\n it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician . \\n it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist . \\n patients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe . \\n prior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe . \\n our results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery . \\n other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery . \\n however , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) . \\n hypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population . \\n in addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe . \\n our findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte . \\n co - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively . \\n both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte . \\n venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study \\n , venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients . \\n perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors . \\n overall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) . \\n a mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered . \\n this approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt . \\n the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry . \\n this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites . \\n most ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week . \\n we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively . \\n the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist . \\n bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry , \\n anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population . \\n the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds . \\n thus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal . \\n dvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission . \\n the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte . \\n over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al . \\n ( hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% ) at a university hospital in delhi . \\n our data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 . \\n this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted . \\n although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 . \\n our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies . \\n this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients , although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted . \\n controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding . \\n follow - up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available . in cases of death , \\n further , the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments , limiting the generalizability of the study results . despite these limitations , \\n this study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , management strategies , and temporal trends in vte , based on  real world \\n data that reflect actual day -

      "{'article': \"anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . \\n although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \\n our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \\n overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \\n for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \\n likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \\n however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \\n one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \\n furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \\n two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \\n the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \\n furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \\n it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \\n it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . \\n given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . \\n furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . \\n seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . \\n the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . \\n inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . \\n patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . \\n ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . \\n patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . \\n thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . \\n this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . \\n self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . \\n a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . \\n this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . \\n the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way \\n this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . \\n processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . \\n attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . \\n working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . \\n language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . \\n the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) \\n demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . \\n chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . \\n all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . \\n spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . \\n as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . \\n groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . \\n additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . \\n there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . \\n the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . \\n neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . \\n logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . \\n there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . \\n participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . \\n lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. \\n this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . \\n the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . \\n more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , \\n these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . \\n although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time \\n , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . \\n recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , \\n for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . \\n it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . \\n anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . \\n this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . \\n noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . \\n selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . \\n future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , \\n future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . \\n research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . \\n future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . \\n previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . \\n for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . \\n thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . \\n it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . \\n results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . \\n although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . \\n recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . \\n based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . \\n future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . \\n another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . \\n future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . \\n one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . \\n although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . \\n controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . \\n considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . \\n anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . \\n moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . \\n future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .\", 'abstract': \"research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life . \\n previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients ; however , to date , no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd . \\n this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . \\n group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . \\n results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . \\n there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , \\n anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set - shifting .\"}\n"

      "{'article': 'a recent systematic analysis showed that in million children younger than years were mildly moderately or severely stunted and million were mildly moderately or severely underweight in the developing countries in iran a study among high school girls in sistan and baluchestan showed prevalence of and for underweight overweight and obesity respectively the prevalence of malnutrition among elementary school aged children in tehran varied from to anthropometric study of elementary school students in shiraz revealed that of them suffer from malnutrition and low body weight snack should have kcal energy and could provide g of protein day nowadays school nutrition programs are running as the national programs world wide national school lunch program in the united states there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries in vietnam school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes in iran a national free food program nffp is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students however this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio economic situation are not covered by nffp although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food hence nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group furthermore lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp on the other hand the most important one is ministry of education moe of iran which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools the ministry of health moh is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs welfare organizations along with charities have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations parent teacher association is a community based institution that participates in school s policy such as nffp in addition to these organizations nutritional literacy of students their parents and teachers is a very important issue which could affect nutritional status of school age children therefore the present study was conducted with the aim of improving the nffp so that by its resources all poor children will be covered even in big cities moreover all food packages were replaced by nutritious and diverse packages that were accessible for non poor children according to the aim of this study and multiple factors that could affect the problem public

showed that the student s average knowledge score has been significantly increased from to p bmi height and weight in non welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately in males and females before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz iran according to study s finding the odds ratio or of sever thinness and thinness in non welfare compared with welfare is or confidence interval ci p furthermore the finding showed or of overweight and obesity in welfare compared to non welfare is or ci p the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio economic level according to our knowledge this is the first study which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city shiraz in iran the other program in iran nffp is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools paying attention of policy makers to student s nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem however negligence of under poverty line providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program advocacy by definition is a blending of science ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions in the present study another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues it seems that in iran free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz at baseline no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre and post nutritional status intervention in contrast the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from to which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age to sd most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population in the age range of the present study female although there is no nffp in big cities of iran there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children psychological test s scores and the grade point average following this school feeding program the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents hence nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children in advocacy program audience s analysis accordingly one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences we also took into account policy makers in different levels from national to local as primary audiences advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories but their benefits should be warranted another choice was community involvement which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student s snacks based on the new definition however there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges moreover providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter sector collaboration although in a limited number of schools in our study interventions and advocacy program was successful expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level in this regard advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject s dietary adherence furthermore this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children', 'abstract': 'background the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school aged children in shiraz iranmaterials and methods this case control nutritional intervention has been done between and on primary and secondary school boys and girls years old based on advocacy approach in shiraz iran the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre and post intervention were statistically comparedresultsthe frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than decreased significantly after intervention among girls p however there were no significant changes among boys or total population the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population the pre and post test education assessment in both groups showed that the student s average knowledge score has been significantly increased from to p conclusion this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight

      "{'article': 'anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson s disease pd more so than overall cognitive status motor deficits apathy and depression although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd yet our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices remains meager and lags far behind that of depression overall neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance for example higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini mental state exam mmse as well as tests of memory and executive functions eg attention likewise apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction however few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety both state and trait and overall cognitive performance measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index within a sample of pd patients furthermore trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ie immediate memory visuospatial construction language attention and delayed memory two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left sided dominant pd lpd versus right sided dominant pd rpd however their findings were inconsistent the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety whereas the second study reported that in lpd apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks eg tmt b wms iii spatial span while in rpd anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks eg clock reading test and boston naming test furthermore anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions taken together it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning it is also striking that to date no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety furthermore since previous work albeit limited has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition we also explored this relationship seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study see table the cross sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past years since at the parkinson s disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre university of sydney inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson s disease society brain bank criteria and were confirmed by a neurologist sjgl patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment ten patients in this study pd with anxiety pd without anxiety were taking psychotropic drugs ie benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders such as anxiety or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale hads thus all participants who scored within a depressed hads d range were excluded from this study in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney and written informed consent was obtained from all participants self reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd a cut off score of on the anxiety subscale of the hads hads a was used to identify pd cases with anxiety pda while a cut off score of on the hads a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety pda this criterion was more stringent than usual cut off score in effort to create distinct patient groups the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr hy stages and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson s disease rating scale updrs in a similar way this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items voluntary movement items and tremor items from the mds updrs part iii see table processing speed was assessed using the trail making test part a tmt a z score attentional set shifting was measured using the trail making test part b tmt b z score working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale iii raw scores language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the

or mann whitney u test depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions chi square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups all analyses employed an alpha level of p and were two tailed spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety andor depression ratings and cognitive functions as expected the pda group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads a u p and higher total score on the hads u p compared to the pda group table groups were matched in age t p disease duration u p updrs iii score u p hy u p ledd u p and depression hads d u p additionally all groups were matched in the distribution of gender p and side affected p there were no group differences for tmt a performance u p table however the pda group had worse performance on the trail making test part b t p compared to the pda group figure the pda group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest t p and backward subtest u p compared to the pda group figures a and b neither semantic verbal fluency t p nor phonemic verbal fluency t p differed between groups logical memory i immediate recall test u p showed a trend that the pda group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group however logical memory ii test performance u p and logical memory retention u p did not differ between groups there were also no differences between groups in global cognition mmse u p participants were split into lpd and rpd and then further group differences were examined between pda and pda importantly the groups remained matched in age disease duration updrs iii dde hy stage and depression but remained significantly different on self reported anxiety lpda demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test t p compared to lpda whereas rpda demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test u p lm i immediate recall u p and lm ii u p but not lm retention u p compared to rpda this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set shifting and working memory in pd more specifically we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set shifting on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety taken together these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early premotor stages of pd related degeneration such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ie raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus resp which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions over time chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries which play a key role in memory and attention recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls therefore chronic stress from anxiety for example may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients however losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd while noradrenaline reuptake blocker atomoxetine has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd overall very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits for example lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology thus cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere eg verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd however this remains controversial it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety although these results align with previous research interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd in addition our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings based on these limitations our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd additionally the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants eg using dsm v criteria rather than relying on self reported measures to group participants in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder eg social anxiety phobias panic disorders and generalized anxiety influences cognitive performance differently in pd one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression although there was a trend that the pda group self reported higher levels of depression than the pda group all participants included in the study scored on the depression subscale of the hads controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options moreover anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait fog which is also related to attentional set shifting future research should examine the link between anxiety set shifting and fog in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog', 'abstract': 'research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson s disease pd has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly of patients and its negative impact on quality of life previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients however to date no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd this study compared cognitive performance across pd participants with and without anxiety pda pda who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains simple attention visuomotor processing speed executive function eg set shifting working memory language and memory new verbal learning results showed that pda performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task tmt b compared to the pda group there were no group differences in verbal fluency logical memory or tmt a performance in conclusion anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set shifting'}\n"

vte can lead to chronic venous disease or recurrent vte and long term debilitating sequelae such as postthrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension vte is not only disabling

in some instances incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism over a years period at three sites to our knowledge this is the first multicenter retrospective registry in india involving patients with vte that reflect real world clinical practice in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age patients in our study were between and years of age while were below years particularly those with pe in a study from north india men constituted of our registry more than those reported from vellore registry but similar to those reported in the endorse epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting study one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine thrombophilia marker in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis this is supported by the fact that only of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy a total of of the overall referrals were from cardiologists the majority of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical specialties as against a referral rate of from surgeons at vellore our finding complements that from the endorse study in which of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease majority of patients in our study had co morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment s and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist investigator most of these patients had swelling of the lower limb it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like swelling of limb instead visited their family physician it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist patients with a history of vte are about times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe prior history of dvt was the most common risk factor in patients who had only dvt whereas past history of pe trauma and immobilization for more than days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe our results major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in patients appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study which reported dvt in patients undergoing major lower limb surgery other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from to in major lower limb surgery however in our study only of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor among the malignancies genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence hypertension was the most common co morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus in this patient population in addition obesity was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe our findings support an asian korean study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with vte co morbid neurological disease other than stroke and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt and pe respectively both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time predisposing them to vte venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively in our study venography was used in just patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one third of the patients perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors overall most patients were managed as inpatients diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte a mean duration of hospitalization of days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data in selected low risk patients outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered this approach was observed in a small proportion of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis nearly all of whom had only dvt the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study was half of that reported in vellore registry this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites most dvt cases were diagnosed between and postoperative weeks but pe in most cases was diagnosed during the first postoperative week we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against and of acute dvt alone and pe alone respectively the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines which recommend at least days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation lmwh fondaparinux intravenous ufh or subcutaneous ufh and at least months of long term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient s age advances in this registry anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only of the study population the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of for major fatal bleeds thus the fear of bleeding complications which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment appears to be minimal dvt complicated by pe and pe alone were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was for primary and for secondary diagnosis we report a hospital readmission rate of however we do not know the cause for readmission the death rate was among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte over of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment in our study the hospital discharge rate was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al hospital discharge rate and death rate at a university hospital in delhi our data show a significant increase in acute dvt pe from to this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from to the burden of pe is almost double of all vte of rate reported at christian medical college vellore during a year period from to our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding follow up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available in cases of death further the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments limiting the generalizability of the study results despite these limitations this study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics clinical outcomes management strategies and temporal trends in vte based on real world data that reflect actual day to day clinical practice over a period of years across three sites in india we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india real world data reflecting actual day to day clinical practice in vte over a period of years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india liesel c dsilva is
