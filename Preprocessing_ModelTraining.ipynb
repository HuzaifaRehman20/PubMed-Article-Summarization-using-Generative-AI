400 kcal energy and could provide 5 - 10 g of protein / day . nowadays , school nutrition programs are running as the national programs , world - wide . national school lunch program in the united states \\n there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries . in vietnam , \\n school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes . in iran a national free food program ( nffp ) \\n is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students . however , this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio - economic situation are not covered by nffp . although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas , many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food . \\n hence , nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group . \\n furthermore , lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp . on the other hand , \\n the most important one is ministry of education ( moe ) of iran , which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools . \\n the ministry of health ( moh ) is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs . \\n welfare organizations , along with charities , have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family . \\n provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations . \\n parent -

welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately among boys and girls before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model . according to this table \\n there were no significant differences in the prevalence of mild , moderate and severe malnutrition among girls and boys . \\n table 4 also shows the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys . \\n the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001 ) . \\n bmi , height and weight in non - welfare and welfare groups of school aged children separately in males and females before and after a nutrition intervention based on advocacy process model in shiraz , iran according to study 's finding the odds ratio ( or ) of sever thinness and thinness in non - welfare compared with welfare is 3.5 ( or = 3.5 , confidence interval [ ci ] = 2.5 - 3.9 , p < 0.001 ) . \\n furthermore , the finding showed or of overweight and obesity in welfare compared to non - welfare is 19.3 ( or = 19.3 , ci = 2.5 - 3.9 , p = 0.04 ) . \\n the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . \\n this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , \\n this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . \\n the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . \\n allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . \\n advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity \\n angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study \\n another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . \\n it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , \\n no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . \\n in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . \\n there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . \\n this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female \\n although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . \\n a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . \\n the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . \\n the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . \\n there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . \\n hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis \\n accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences \\n . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . \\n advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . \\n providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . \\n another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . \\n advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . \\n mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . \\n moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . \\n although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this \\n regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . \\n the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . \\n assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . \\n furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . \\n the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . \\n regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe . \\n community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .\", 'abstract': \"background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran . \\n the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) . \\n however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population . \\n the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population . \\n the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001).conclusion : this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran . \\n community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .\"}\n"

world clinical practice . in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age , 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years , particularly those with pe . in a study from north india , \\n men constituted 70% of our registry , more than those reported from vellore registry ( 48% ) , but similar to those reported in the endorse ( epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting ) study ( 69% ) . \\n one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study . \\n fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis . \\n this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy . \\n a total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore . \\n our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) . \\n most ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb . \\n it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician . \\n it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist . \\n patients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe . \\n prior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe . \\n our results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery . \\n other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery . \\n however , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) . \\n hypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population . \\n in addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe . \\n our findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte . \\n co - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively . \\n both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte . \\n venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study \\n , venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients . \\n perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors . \\n overall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) . \\n a mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered . \\n this approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt . \\n the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry . \\n this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites . \\n most ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week . \\n we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively . \\n the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist . \\n bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry , \\n anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population . \\n the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds . \\n thus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal . \\n dvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission . \\n the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte . \\n over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al . \\n ( hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% ) at a university hospital in delhi . \\n our data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 . \\n this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted . \\n although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 . \\n our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies . \\n this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients , although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted . \\n controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding . \\n follow - up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available . in cases of death , \\n further , the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments , limiting the generalizability of the study results . despite these limitations , \\n this study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , management strategies , and temporal trends in vte , based on  real world \\n data that reflect actual day -

      "{'article': \"anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . \\n although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \\n our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \\n overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \\n for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \\n likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \\n however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \\n one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \\n furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \\n two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \\n the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \\n furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \\n it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \\n it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . \\n given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . \\n furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . \\n seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . \\n the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . \\n inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . \\n patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . \\n ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . \\n patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . \\n thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . \\n this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . \\n self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . \\n a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . \\n this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . \\n the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way \\n this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . \\n processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . \\n attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . \\n working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . \\n language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . \\n the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) \\n demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . \\n chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . \\n all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . \\n spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . \\n as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . \\n groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . \\n additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . \\n there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . \\n the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . \\n neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . \\n logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . \\n there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . \\n participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . \\n lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. \\n this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . \\n the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . \\n more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , \\n these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . \\n although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time \\n , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . \\n recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , \\n for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . \\n it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . \\n anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . \\n this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . \\n noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . \\n selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . \\n future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , \\n future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . \\n research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . \\n future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . \\n previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . \\n for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . \\n thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . \\n it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . \\n results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . \\n although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . \\n recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . \\n based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . \\n future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . \\n another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . \\n future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . \\n one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . \\n although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . \\n controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . \\n considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . \\n anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . \\n moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . \\n future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .\", 'abstract': \"research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life . \\n previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients ; however , to date , no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd . \\n this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . \\n group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . \\n results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . \\n there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , \\n anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set - shifting .\"}\n"

       "{'article': 'atrial fibrillation af is the most common sustained arrhythmia in western countries with an estimated million patients affected by across united states and europe alone atrial fibrillation has a significant impact on morbidity mainly related to symptoms heart failure and thromboembolic events and is the most frequent arrhythmic cause of hospital admission in the usa in addition af is associated with excess mortality independently of thromboembolic complications to date the most effective treatment for af is radiofrequency catheter ablation and pulmonary vein antrum isolation pvai is the mainstay of such an approach the major drawback of catheter ablation of af consists in its potential risk of periprocedural complications with thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications being among the most common and insidious ones despite the introduction of novel ablation technologies such as open irrigation catheters and the widespread use of systemic anticoagulation with heparin the risk of periprocedural thromboembolism remains not negligible reaching up to in large series with these premises the development of novel strategies able to further decrease the risk of periprocedural thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding is crucial oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin is the current standard of care for the treatment of af with a strikingly favorable balance between thromboembolic protection and bleeding complications when adequate monitoring of international normalized ratio inr is achieved for years discontinuation of warfarin before ablation associated with the periprocedural use of unfractioned and low molecular weight heparin and bridging with warfarin after ablation has been the most widespread anticoagulation protocol in patients undergoing catheter ablation of af we firstly described the feasibility of af ablation without interruption of oral anticoagulation and recently reported that this approach is able to potentially abolish thromboembolic complications without increasing the risk of bleeding accordingly af ablation without interruption of anticoagulation is nowadays the standard protocol in our center in this paper we summarize our approach to anticoagulation in patients undergoing af ablation patients eligible for catheter ablation of af are started on warfarin as outpatients at least months before the scheduled procedure all patients receive weekly inr monitoring during the to weeks preceding the procedure with a target inr of to preprocedural transesophageal echocardiography tee is performed only in patients showing sub therapeutic inr values in the month prior to the procedure patients who demonstrate inr values consistently above in the month before the procedure are directly sent to ablation four venous accesses are obtained two right and one left femoral venous accesses and one right internal jugular vein access femoral venous accesses are usually obtained with the seldinger technique or with ultrasound guidance in difficult cases the right internal jugular vein is accessed with ultrasound guidance or under fluoroscopic guidance with a wire or a deflectable catheter advanced into this vein via the right femoral vein sheath a double transseptal puncture is performed with the assistance of intracardiac echocardiography ice before transseptal punctures all patients receive a bolus of unfractionated heparin units followed by a noncontinuous infusion to maintain an activated coagulation time act seconds we found important the addition of unfractionated heparin to periprocedural therapeutic warfarin since soft thrombus can still be observed on the transeptal sheath or left atrial catheters in patients with periprocedural therapeutic inr radiofrequency energy is delivered with an open irrigated ablation catheter with a maximum temperature of c power up to w and flow rate of cmmin intracardiac echocardiography is continuously used to monitor the electrode surface during ablation to assist with catheter positioning and identify coagulum formation and to monitor for complications including pericardial effusion an esophageal temperature probe is always inserted to assist with power titration during posterior wall ablation at the end of the left atrial ablation we partially reverse heparin anticoagulation with up to mg of protamine guided by the act and remove the sheaths when the act is less than seconds with this approach the majority of the major bleedings are related to cardiac tamponade which can be effectively managed with emergent pericardiocentesis together with heparin interruption and reversal with protamine and warfarin reversal with fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate if continued significant drainage or reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion occurs despite these measures emergent open surgical exploration is considered notably there is also no difference in rates of emergent surgical exploration between patients with periprocedural therapeutic inr and those who discontinue warfarin although patients on therapeutic anticoagulation are more likely to have a larger amount of blood removed from their pericardium for stabilization and require more blood transfusion units all patients receive a single dose of aspirin mg before leaving the electrophysiology laboratory and continue their warfarin dosage regimens to maintain a target inr of to after ablation the thromboembolic risk may be further increased by the procedure related endothelial damage which may activate the coagulation cascade and increase the risk of thromboembolism therefore warfarin discontinuation may be associated with an increased thromboembolic risk also in the postprocedural period since reachieving a therapeutic inr after the procedure may take several days and the risk of left atrial thrombosis during af is strikingly time dependent all patients are strictly monitored for outcome and complications during overnight hospital stay and on the following day prior to discharge using symptom assessment serial neurological examinations and puncture site checks all patients are instructed to call in case of any symptom development and to send weekly transtelephonic electrocardiogram transmissions for the first months after ablation progress of recovery and symptoms are assessed as well by a dedicated nurse in case of symptoms or suspected complications patients are asked to seek medical attention at either a local emergency department or our emergency department or to follow up with their local physician moreover all patients present for followup to months after ablation with the electrophysiologist who performed the procedure with regard to the out of hospital long term anticoagulation management patients are referred to dedicated anticoagulation clinics with the aim of maintaining a stable therapeutic inr level we follow a standard uniform and validated protocol of long term postprocedural anticoagulation management briefly oral anticoagulation is discontinued regardless of the chads score if patients do not experience any recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias severe pulmonary vein stenosis pulmonary vein narrowing and severe left atrial mechanical dysfunction as assessed by transthoracic echocardiography patients with a chads score experiencing early recurrence of af are maintained on warfarin for at least months in these patients warfarin is discontinued if there is no af recurrence in the last months without antiarrhythmic drugs and aspirin to mg is started in case of new af recurrence after warfarin discontinuation in patients with a chads score oral anticoagulation our approach to periprocedural anticoagulation has been extensively validated in previous work in particular we found that a conventional anticoagulation approach which included warfarin discontinuation with peri and postprocedural bridging with unfractioned and low molecular weight heparin actually increases the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications as compared to no periprocedural interruption of oral anticoagulation our most recent report provides strong evidence that performing af ablation under therapeutic inr is a safe and effective approach to virtually abolish the risk of thromboembolic complications we reported a multicenter prospective comparison of three anticoagulation protocols in centers performing the same ablation procedure a total of patients were included in the study of whom underwent ablation with an mm ablation catheter and preprocedural warfarin discontinuation group underwent ablation with an open irrigated catheter and preprocedural warfarin discontinuation group and underwent ablation with an open irrigated catheter without preprocedural warfarin discontinuation group overall periprocedural thromboembolic complications occurred in patients with a rate of in group and of in group these data support also the appropriateness of our approach to tee based on the intensity of anticoagulation in the month preceding the procedure especially considering that group patients had persistent af and long standing persistent af at multivariable analysis which adjusted for age gender coronary artery disease type of af heart failure diabetes hypertension and prior stroke the anticoagulation strategy of ablation with a therapeutic inr was a strong independent predictor of lower periprocedural thromboembolic events odds ratio confidence interval to p with regard to bleedings the pooled rate of major bleeding complications ie bleeding requiring interventions including transfusions hemopericardium hemothorax and retroperitoneal bleeding and pericardial effusion in patients who discontinued warfarin before the ablation procedure groups and was whereas in group was figure if also minor bleedings were included patients who discontinued warfarin before ablation procedure had a pooled rate of bleeding complications of while patients who were maintained on warfarin had a rate of translating such percentages into treatment effects the net clinical benefit associated with af ablation without interruption of oral anticoagulation is overwhelming figure with an estimated thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications avoided every patients ablated in the most recent survey on af catheter ablation cappato et al reported thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complication rates in patients undergoing af ablation between and in centers distributed worldwide all these patients had oral anticoagulant discontinuation before the ablation procedure accordingly thromboembolic and bleeding complication rates in this large survey were fairly consistent with that reported in group and patients of our study based on our findings it is estimable that if periprocedural oral anticoagulation was not discontinued in all patients included in the survey more than thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications would have been avoided worldwide from to therefore there are cogent data supporting the benefit of af ablation without discontinuation of oral anticoagulation since the acute reversal of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin is possible only through infusion of fresh coagulation factors we routinely type and cross match all patients so that packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma are readily available for infusion in case of hemorragic complications if the preprocedural inr is above we partially reverse the anticoagulant effect with one to two units of fresh frozen plasma of interest the strategy of ablation under therapeutic inr could also be more cost effective compared to bridging therapy with enoxaparin which is expensive and may be inconvenient for many patients radiofrequency catheter ablation of af without discontinuation of oral anticoagulation significantly reduces the risk of thromboembolic and minor bleeding complications maintenance of periprocedural therapeutic inr should be considered the anticoagulation strategy of choice among patients submitted to catheter ablation of af',\n",
       " 'abstract': 'atrial fibrillation af can be cured by pulmonary vein antrum isolation pvai in a substantial proportion of patients the high efficacy of pvai is partially undermined by a small but concrete periprocedural risk of complications such as thromboembolic events and bleeding a correct management of anticoagulation is essential to prevent such complications performing pvai without interruption of oral anticoagulation has been demonstrated feasible by our group in previous studies recently we reported that continuation of therapeutic warfarin during radiofrequency catheter ablation consistently reduces the risk of periprocedural stroke transient ischemic attack without increasing the risk of hemorrhagic events of note interrupting warfarin anticoagulation may actually increase the risk of stroke even when bridged with heparin the latter strategy is also associated with an increased risk of minor bleeding with regard to major bleeding we found no significant difference between patients with a therapeutic inr and those who were bridged with heparin therefore continuation of therapeutic warfarin during ablation of af appears to be the best anticoagulation strategy in this paper we summarize our experience with af ablation without interruption of anticoagulation'}"

psychological distress and can have a traumatizing effect on parents the neonatal intensive care unit nicu environment has the potential to exacerbate stress for parents of infants admitted to the nicu mothers have typically been found to have higher levels of distress than fathers and they experience significant levels of stress and depression in the early postpartum period maternal stress can have deleterious effects on mother infant interaction particularly on mothers abilities to form an attachment to their baby maternal stress diminishes the mother s ability to be sensitive to the infant s cues and be responsive in interacting with the infant participating in infant care influences the maternal feelings in a positive direction finding of a study has shown that a mother who is denied the opportunity comparing to a mother whose child is left feeling confused and anxious when the mother is nearby breastfeeds and takes care of her child s daily care she has a feeling of participation this situation creates a need for practices that support parents during the acute phase of their infant s hospitalization in neonatal intensive care the facilitation of maternal confidence and positive parenting in the nicu may be a key point in establishing and sustaining long term healthy mother infant interactions and positive child outcomes nicus have been established in iran since about and today they are running in the state and private hospitals of provinces under the supervision of a neonatologist there are high tech equipments for infants treatment in most of these wards and mothers can settle in specific rooms close to the ward so that they can go to their infants to take care of them primarily based on their willing and abilities at the times fathers can also visit their infants in specific hours but they can not stay there and no health care is provided for them the premature birth rate in the place of research esfahan isfahan is about and due to the prepared facilities especially in the state hospitals many of these infants would be saved in iran no organized goal oriented effort has been taken to increase the parents information and confidence and to decrease the mothers stress and anxiety following giving birth to an immature infant and its being in nicu this would cause distress in mother infant interaction and so the absence of timely and effective mothers participation in taking care of the infant on the other hand the nursing workload in nicus is too high and nurses do not have enough time to help parents regarding without to these points researchers tend to conduct the creating opportunities for parent empowerment cope program in this survey as a result researchers tend to conduct the creating opportunities for parent

nicus of state hospitals affiliated to isfahan university of medical sciences in iran bed nicu in shaheed beheshti hospital and bed nicu in alzahra hospital following the father s inability to stay long and take care of the infant in ward s environment all mothers who were years and older could read and speak persian had no infant admitted to the nicu and with infants with the following criteria participated in this study a gestational age of weeks b birth weight of less than g and appropriate for gestational age c anticipated survival d singleton birth e no severe handicapping conditions and f born at the study sites mothers were excluded from the study if they did not visit their infants for more than days and if their infants died or discharged before completing the cope program researchers screened premature births and of them met the eligibility criteria figure among these eligible births mothers refused participation with the majority of them wanting to concentrate only on the new infant or they believed that participation would take time away from the other children at home researchers were unable to contact the mothers of premature infants who met the eligibility criteria mothers who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to the study conditions by using rand function in excel the final sample after randomization comprised mothers after enrollment and randomization of the study groups data for mothers were eliminated from the study for analyses five mothers in the cope program were eliminated from the study because of infant death n transfer to another hospital n or completion of baseline measures only n five comparison mothers also were eliminated from the analysis because of infant death n or completion of baseline measures only n therefore the final sample for data analyses included mothers in the cope and in the comparison group the well known state trait anxiety inventory stai was used to measure maternal state and trait anxiety current feelings of anxiety are measured with the a state scale while an individual s anxiety proneness is measured in the item trait scale a trait a state was used as the dependent variable to assess mothers current anxiety levels trait anxiety was assessed at one contact point only to measure anxiety proneness maternal trait anxiety and demographic measures are considered as important covariates in the study because findings from prior research have supported that these variables have potential effects on maternal state anxiety and mother infant interaction the reliability was measured by cronbach s alpha and it was for state anxiety and for trait anxiety content validity index was measured as validity and it was for state anxiety and for trait anxiety the parental stressor scale neonatal intensive care pss nicu assessed parental stress in the nicu arising from four dimensions a sights and sounds b infant behavior and appearance c parental role alteration and d staff behaviors and communication parents rate their perceptions of the stress level generated by each of the items on a point likert scale ranging from non stressful to extremely stressful the index of parental participation hospitalized infant ipp hi is an instrument that is designed for nurses andor mothers to rate the range of care related activities that mothers were observed or reported themselves to be involved in while there infant is hospitalized in an nicu the ipp hi is described as a item dichotomous instrument that measures a range of previous h time period activities of mothers including items that pertain to routine infant care basic illness related care emotional and developmental care information seeking and involvement in care by serving as an advocate and a decision maker cronbach s alpha was and content validity index was concerning the point that it takes more time to implement phase iii of the cope program and that phase iv is conducted on the basis of home visit which is not common in iran these phases were omitted with the program designer s permission the issues of every phase consist of the scientific information in simple language which almost coincided with nicus conditions in iran the necessary reformation regarding the context s eloquence and fluency was done with the help of three faculty members of the school of nursing and midwifery shaheed beheshti medical university then the information was prepared in the form of audiotape and a booklet a separate booklet for every phase with related picture finally in order to measure the booklet and audiotape fluency and clearness in mothers opinion a pilot study was done on five mothers in each hospital there was a suitable room without noise and shuttling beside the nicu which were useless in the evening mothers came to this place alone and one of the researchers gave instruments to them to complete two to four days post nicu admission the mother completed demographic and infant variables questionnaire as well as state anxiety inventory and the parental stressor scale then the phase i booklet was given to the mother and she listened to its audiotape manipulation checks consisted of true or false questions that the mother answered immediately after each intervention phase to assure they processed the audiotaped information the first set of activity workbook was then given to the mother with specific instructions on how to complete four to eight days post nicu admission the mother completed stai and the parental stressor scale next the phase booklet was given to the mother and she listened to its audiotape then the mother answered the phase manipulation check questions and at the end she received phase ii of activity workbook with specific instructions on how to complete six to twelve days post nicu admission was the last visit of the research for each mother and she completed state anxiety inventory the parental stressor scale and the ipp hi researcher requested the mother to complete the workbook activities and she monitored them throughout the study researcher prompted the mothers who had not completed the activities by the time of the next phase of the intervention to perform them by the next contact mothers in the comparison group filled out all questionnaires at the same time as the intervention group and days after infant hospitalization they did not receive the cope program but using the content of each phase of the cope program one of the researchers answered all their questions after ultimate assessment days after infant hospitalization this group also received a booklet which is a combination of phases i and ii of the cope program two to four days post nicu admission the mother completed demographic and infant variables questionnaire as well as state anxiety inventory and the parental stressor scale then the phase i booklet was given to the mother and she listened to its audiotape manipulation checks

they did not receive the cope program but using the content of each phase of the cope program one of the researchers answered all their questions after ultimate assessment days after infant hospitalization this group also received a booklet which is a combination of phases i and ii of the cope program data were analyzed using spss for windows a p value of was set for statistical significance in addition t tests for continuous variables analyses for categorical variables and mann whitney u test for qualitative variables were performed to determine if the two study groups differed in these baseline factors spearman correlation test and repeated measurements test were also performed among the mothers no significant group differences were found at baseline in maternal demographic and infant variables tables and in addition no baseline differences between groups were found for stress and anxiety table comparability of the cope intervention and comparison groups conditions comparability of the cope intervention and comparison groups infant conditions during the nicu hospitalization mothers in the cope program reported significantly less overall parental stress in the nicu than did mothers in the comparison group figure mothers state anxiety decreased over time with significant cope and comparison group differences identified figure mothers in the cope program were also more involved in their infants care in the nicu than the comparison mothers figure maternal stress over time maternal state anxiety over time maternal participation cope mothers had also significantly high total scores on the questions in manipulation checks dealing with the cope program content indicating that mothers processed the content of the program from all two phases of the interventions the purpose of this study was to perform the cope program for iranian mothers and evaluate its effectiveness on the level of stress anxiety and participation of mothers who have premature infants hospitalized in nicus findings of this study provide additional support for earlier studies that proved instructing parents in premature behavior and involving them in the care of their infant may facilitate bonding increase parents confidence in care giving and possibly improve the parent child relationship after performing just the first stage of the program the state anxiety level of the mothers reduced and after performing phase ii of the program the state anxiety level of the mothers further reduced since most mothers education was less than diploma it can be said that the information in phases i and ii could the level of education in most of the mothers was less than diploma high school it can be said that the information in phases i and ii could provide iranian mothers information needs clear information of the infant s condition provided for parents on a regular basis facilitates accurate perception of the infant s morbidity with subsequent alterations in distress levels after performing two phases of cope program mothers stress reduced in the experimental group while assessments conducted at the same time in the control group indicated that stress in the second assessment was more than in the first one this finding indicates that parents of premature infants experience heightened anxiety and stress during and following their infants nicu stay cope mothers were significantly less stressed related to nicu because they were given concrete information regarding the nicu environment and what to expect of their premature infants the results of this study showed that the mothers participation in the experimental group was more than that in the control group through the parental role information in the cope program mothers learned how best to interact with their infants during hospitalization and were encouraged to be involved in their infants care nursing support reduces parental stress and anxiety during infants nicu hospitalization and therefore fosters the parents abilities to cope with the difficulties they are facing giving understandable information is critical for optimal parental involvement in their infant s care in the study of melnyk et al all four phases of the cope program were conducted in the usa the results of this study demonstrate the following mothers in the cope program reported significantly less overall parental stress in the nicu than did mothers in the comparison group the level of mothers anxiety reduced at the end of program after performing phase iv and the mother s participation in taking care of the infant did not have significant statistical differences between the two groups contrasting this study with the study of melnyk et al the findings of the two studies are the same in the effect of program on the mothers stress related to nicu however the results of anxiety and participation are different also there are differences in the socioeconomic status of samples in the two studies most of the mothers education was less than a diploma in the present study while most of the mothers had an education level of more than a diploma in the study of melnyk et al also the income of most of the families in this study was less than but the families in melnyk et al s study had more than as income according to the above analysis further and earlier effect of program in this study can be due to economical and cultural differences between samples on the other hand welfare and educational facilities and psychological support are not the same in these two countries this is the supportive finding for this claim that higher ses socioeconomic status mothers have stricter and more demanding cognitive schemas for their own beliefs confidence in how they should parent their premature infants while lower socioeconomic status mothers may have schemas that are less rigid one of the limitations of this study is that it was conducted in only the state hospitals potential differences in practice may exist in private institutions that may influence generalizability of the findings it also would be possible to determine if the intervention program may have positive effect on fathers psychological condition in the situation that they could not participate in their infants care during hospitalization in the nicu analyzing the results of the present study specified that psychological status and participation of iranian mothers who had premature infants improved by presenting cope intervention in the nicus during this program mothers knew about the differences between their infants and mature infants and they learned how to play their maternal role in the nicu and how to interact suitably with their infants therefore the results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies regarding theory based intervention with parents of premature infants that begins early in the nicu stay and results in less parental stress in the nicu more positive parent infant interactions in the nicu and less parental anxiety after hospitalization',\n",
